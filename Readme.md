## Classic and Early project of Credit Card Fraud Detection using various ML Algorithms.
**NOTE** :
 Used SMOTE in imbalanced data.
#### Overview of SMOTE:
 ```
    SMOTE, which stands for Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique, is a popular technique in the field of machine learning and data-imbalanced classification.
    It is used to address the problem of class imbalance, where one class in a classification problem has significantly fewer instances than the other class(es).
    In a class-imbalanced dataset, the model may become biased towards the majority class, leading to poor performance on the minority class. SMOTE is a method to     
    balance the class distribution by generating synthetic examples for the minority class.
